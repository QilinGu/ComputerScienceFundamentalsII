# ComputerScienceFundamentalsII
Computer Science 1027 - A continuation of Computer Science 1026A/B. Data organization and manipulation; abstract data types and their implementations in an object-oriented setting (Java); lists, stacks, queues, trees; pointers; recursion; file handling and storage. 

## Billing Service
Build a customer billing service for magazine subscribers as a Java program. Magazines are available in both digital and print formats at different prices. Given a list of customers and their magazine subscription information and a list of magazines and their prices you are to generate bills for each customer.

## Maze Solver
Build a maze solver java program that searches through all opens spaces, one at a time, until the end is found. This program uses a stack to keep track of the hexagonal tiles yet to be checked.

## Checkout Process
Build a java program to simulate supermarket checkout strategies to determine the minimum average customer wait times. During simulation, we must be able to determine the next event that will occur. The problem is this event may not be the first event on the queue. One way to handle this problem is to use a priority queue.

## Path to Root
Build a java program to test and show the path to root of a small or large tree. As well as gain experience working with several topics presented in the course, including recursion, iterators, lists, binary trees and tree traversal.
